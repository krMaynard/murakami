<p><strong>Chapter 15, Book 2 Translation</strong>1</p>
<p>正しい名前、夏の朝にサラダオイルをかけて焼かれたもの、不正確なメタファー The right name, the things burned with salad oil on a summer morning, a faulty metaphor&nbsp;</p>
<p>Come morning, Creta Kano had lost her name. Just as the dawn broke Creta Kano&nbsp; quietly awakened me. Coming to and opening my eyes I caught the morning light&nbsp; streaming in through a slit in the curtains. Next, I saw the profile of the woman shifting&nbsp; her body in bed to look at me. In place of sleepwear she wore my old T-shirt, but this&nbsp; covered her entire body. Her pubic hair cast a faint gleam in the sunlight.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Okada. I no longer have a name,&rdquo; said <em>she</em>. She had quit being a prostitute,&nbsp; quit being a medium, and quit being Creta Kano.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, you&rsquo;re not Creta Kano anymore,&rdquo; I said. I rubbed my eye with a fingertip.&nbsp; &ldquo;Congratulations. You&rsquo;re a new person. But without a name, what should I call you?&nbsp; Without a name it&rsquo;ll be a pain if I have to call you from behind or something.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>She &ndash; the woman who up until last night was Creta Kano &ndash; shook her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Perhaps I must search for a new name. Long ago I had a real name.&nbsp; Then, as a prostitute &ndash; though I never want to say it again &ndash; I had a fake name. When I&nbsp; quit prostitution, for the me who would act as a medium Malta Kano gave the name Creta&nbsp; Kano. But as I am no longer any of those people, for a new me I believe an entirely new&nbsp; name is necessary. Mr. Okada, haven&rsquo;t you any suggestions? Something like a suitable&nbsp; name for me?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I mulled it over but couldn&rsquo;t conjure up a good name.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably something you need to come up with yourself. Because you&rsquo;re&nbsp; starting a new life as an independent person and all. It might take a while, but I definitely&nbsp; think that&rsquo;s best.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, this &lsquo;finding the proper name for myself&rsquo; is difficult.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s not easy. &lsquo;Cause a name in some cases expresses everything,&rdquo; I&nbsp; said. &ldquo;It may be better for me too to completely get rid of my name. I&rsquo;ve got that feeling.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Malta Kano&rsquo;s sister sat up in bed, reached out her hand and touched her fingertips&nbsp; to my right cheek. There I assumed was still a mark about the size of a baby&rsquo;s palm. &ldquo;<em>If </em>Mr. Okada were to lose his name here, what shall I call him?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wind-Up Bird,&rdquo; I said. In any case, at least I had a new name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wind-Up Bird,&rdquo; she said, then floated that name in the air and stared at it.&nbsp; &ldquo;A wonderful name, I think, but just what kind of bird is that?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Wind-Up Bird&rsquo;s a bird that really exists. What it looks like, even I don&rsquo;t&nbsp; know, &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;ve never seen it in real life. I&rsquo;ve only heard its voice. The Wind-Up Bird&nbsp; stops in the branches of those trees and little by little winds the spring of the world. With&nbsp; the screech of twisting metal winds the spring. If the Wind-Up Bird doesn&rsquo;t wind the&nbsp; spring, the world won&rsquo;t move. But nobody knows that. All the people of the world think&nbsp; some big, fancy, complicated device moves the earth. But that&rsquo;s not it. Really, the Wind Up-Bird goes from place to place, winds the tiny springs a bit at a time, and moves the&nbsp; earth. They&rsquo;re simple springs, like the kind you find in wind-up toys. All you have to do&nbsp; is wind the springs, but only the Wind-Up Bird can see them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wind-Up Bird,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Mr. Wind-Up Bird, who winds the spring of the&nbsp; world.&rdquo; I raised my head and looked around; I saw the same room as always. I&rsquo;d been&nbsp; sleeping only in that room for the last four or five years, but it appeared perplexingly&nbsp; hollow and vast.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But sad as it is I don&rsquo;t know where to find the spring. And what form that spring&nbsp; takes, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">She put her finger on my shoulder. Then, with her fingertip drew a circle. I lay face-up, and for a long time concentrated on a tiny stomach-shaped stain on&nbsp; the ceiling. The stain was precisely over my pillow. I&rsquo;d never before noticed the existence&nbsp; of such a stain. <em>Exactly when was that place stained? </em>I wondered. It had probably been&nbsp; there since we moved in. So, the whole time Kumiko and I slept together in that bed, that&nbsp; stain was silent, holding its breath, stuck right over us. Then one morning I spotted it. Beside me I felt the warmth of the breath of the woman formerly known as Creta&nbsp; Kano. I could smell that fragrant naked flesh. She was still busy drawing little circles on&nbsp; my shoulder. If I could I wanted to reach out and take her again, but whether or not that&nbsp; was right I couldn&rsquo;t decide. My relationships vertical and horizontal were way too tangled. I abandoned the idea and went back to staring at the ceiling. Malta Kano&rsquo;s sister&nbsp; then leaned over me and softly kissed my right cheek. Something like a deep paralysis&nbsp; struck me as her supple lips gentled the mark.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I closed my eyes and tuned my ears to the sound of the world. Somewhere, I&nbsp; heard a pigeon cry. &ldquo;Ho, ho, ho,&rdquo; it persisted, filled with good will that celebrated the&nbsp; summer morning and announced the break of day. But that&rsquo;s not enough, I thought. Someone&rsquo;s got to wind the spring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wind-up Bird,&rdquo; said the woman formerly known as Creta Kano. &ldquo;I believe&nbsp; that certainly, some day, you will find that spring.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eyes closed, I asked, &ldquo;If so, and say someday I find the spring, and wind it, do&nbsp; you think a normal life will come back to me?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>She shook her head. A little something like sadness crept into her eyes, like a&nbsp; broken nimbus clouds the sky.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody knows,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Some things in the world are better unknown, </em>said Lt. Mamiya.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Malta Kano&rsquo;s little sister said she wanted to go to a beauty salon. Since she had&nbsp; no money at all (having turned up stark naked), I lent her money. Wearing Kumiko&rsquo;s&nbsp; blouse she slipped into a skirt and sandals and left for the salon near the train station. It&nbsp; was the one Kumiko used to use.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once Malta Kano&rsquo;s sister left I gave the floor an overdue cleaning and tossed the&nbsp; piled laundry into the wash. I pulled all drawers out of my desk and dumped them into a&nbsp; cardboard box. I planned to save the necessities and torch the rest, but in reality the&nbsp; &ldquo;necessities&rdquo; were pretty much nonexistent; everything in there was something useless: an old diary, age-old unfinished letters, a planner crammed with long-past engagements,&nbsp; an address book lined with names of people who&rsquo;d passed through my life, discolored&nbsp; scraps of newspapers and magazines, an expired membership card for the pool, a tape&nbsp; recorder&rsquo;s warranty and instructions, used pens and pencils, somebody&rsquo;s phone number&nbsp; jotted on a memo (whose number I had no clue). I took the letters I&rsquo;d kept in the closet&nbsp; and burned them. About half those letters were from Kumiko. We wrote each other a lot before we got married. Kumiko&rsquo;s fine and careful handwriting lined the envelopes. Her&nbsp; handwriting hadn&rsquo;t really changed in the last seven years. Even used the same ink. I took the cardboard box into the garden, doused it with salad oil and struck a&nbsp; match. The box went up in a nice blaze, but it took longer than I was expecting to reduce&nbsp; everything to ash. On that windless day the white plume of smoke shot straight up into&nbsp; the sky, stretching through the clouds like a giant tree out of &ldquo;Jack and the Beanstalk.&rdquo; If&nbsp; I climbed all the way up, perhaps there&rsquo;d be gathered all my past selves, living the good&nbsp; life in their own little world. I kept my gaze on that smoke, sitting on a stone in the&nbsp; garden. It was a hot summer morning that prophesized an afternoon hotter still. My T shirt was sweat-plastered against my skin. In Russian novels, things like letters are best&nbsp; burned in the fireplace on a winter night. Things like burning them with salad oil in the&nbsp; garden on a summer morning just aren&rsquo;t done. But in the wretched, Realistic world in&nbsp; which we live, people soaked in sweat burn letters on summer mornings. With some&nbsp; things we can&rsquo;t do as we like. Some things can&rsquo;t wait until winter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once everything was burned I scooped water in a bucket, extinguished the flames,&nbsp; and with the sole of my shoe ground the ash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With all my things in order I went to Kumiko&rsquo;s room and examined her desk. I&nbsp; hadn&rsquo;t looked inside since she&rsquo;d left home. I had felt like it wasn&rsquo;t an upright thing to do.&nbsp; But as she herself had said she was never coming back she probably wouldn&rsquo;t mind my&nbsp; pulling out her desk drawer. It seemed before leaving she&rsquo;d seen to the desk: the drawer&nbsp; was almost empty. Left were new stationery and envelopes, a box of paper clips, a ruler,&nbsp; scissors, a half-dozen pens and pencils, like she&rsquo;d cleared things so she might leave at&nbsp; any time. Nothing that suggested Kumiko&rsquo;s existence remained. But what had she done&nbsp; with her letters from me? She should have had just as many, and she should have saved them somewhere, but they were nowhere to be found.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next I entered the bathroom and boxed all the cosmetics. Lipstick, cleansing&nbsp; cream, perfume, hairspray, eyebrow pencils, cotton pads, lotion, and other things I didn&rsquo;t&nbsp; know what they were I gathered and chucked into a candy box. There weren&rsquo;t that many&nbsp; items. Kumiko wasn&rsquo;t that into cosmetics. I threw away Kumiko&rsquo;s toothbrush and dental&nbsp; floss. I threw out her shower cap.</p>

<p>Just completing those tasks had exhausted me. I sat in the kitchen and drank a&nbsp; glass of water. The only things left of Kumiko&rsquo;s were a small shelf&rsquo;s worth of books and&nbsp; her clothes. The books I&rsquo;d sell. The clothes were a problem. Kumiko had written for me&nbsp; to &ldquo;properly dispose of&rdquo; her clothes. That she had no intention of wearing them again.&nbsp; But in practice how exactly I should &ldquo;dispose of&rdquo; them, she didn&rsquo;t elaborate. Should I sell&nbsp; them? Or stuff them in vinyl bags and trash them? Give them away? Donate them to the&nbsp; Salvation Army? None of those things seemed to me like a &ldquo;proper&rdquo; sort of method.&nbsp; <em>Whatever, there&rsquo;s no hurry, </em>I thought. For the time being I&rsquo;d just leave them be. (The&nbsp; woman who was once) Creta Kano might wear them, or Kumiko might reconsider and&nbsp; come back for them. Unthinkable at the moment, but who could say for sure? Nobody&nbsp; knows what may happen tomorrow. The day after tomorrow is even more unknown. Or,&nbsp; if you&rsquo;re going to say that, we have no idea what may happen this afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The woman who was once Creta Kano returned from the beauty parlor just before&nbsp; noon. Her new hairstyle was surprisingly short, the longest patches being only about&nbsp; three or four centimeters. She&rsquo;d done the whole thing up in hair cream. Since she&rsquo;d taken&nbsp; off her makeup at first I hardly recognized her. In any case she no longer looked liked&nbsp; Jacqueline Kennedy. I praised her new hairstyle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way looks much younger and more natural, but it seems like you turned into&nbsp; someone else.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <em>have </em>become someone else!&rdquo; she said, and laughed. I suggested we have lunch&nbsp; together, but she shook her head. &ldquo;Mr. Okada. Mr. Wind-Up Bird,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I believe I&nbsp; have taken the first step as a new human being. I&rsquo;ll go home, have a long talk with my&nbsp; sister, and prepare for Crete. Getting my passport, buying the plane ticket, packing my&nbsp; bags: I&rsquo;m not at all used to doing these things, so I am not sure how to go about it. I&rsquo;ve&nbsp; never once traveled, or even been outside Tokyo.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you still think we ought to go to Crete together?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;For me, and for you, I believe that is best. So I hope you will please think it over. This is very important.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think about it,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>The woman who was once Creta Kano left the house, and I put on a fresh Polo&nbsp; and long trousers. I wore sunglasses so the mark wouldn&rsquo;t stand out, then walked through&nbsp; the glaring sun to the station and took the rattling afternoon train to Shinjuku. I bought&nbsp; two Greece travel guides from Kinokuniya and a medium-size suitcase from Isetan. I&nbsp; spotted a restaurant and decided to have lunch. The waitress was terribly surly and ill tempered. I fancied myself well-versed in surly, ill-tempered waitresses, but a waitress of&nbsp; such ill-tempered surliness I&rsquo;d never met. She seemed disgusted by my order and me as a&nbsp; human being. While I chose from the menu she glared at the mark on my face like she&rsquo;d&nbsp; just drawn an unlucky <em>o-mikuji</em>2. I could feel her gaze on the mark. I ordered a small&nbsp; bottle of beer but she brought over a large. I didn&rsquo;t complain. When a cold, frothy beer&nbsp; comes along, be thankful. If it&rsquo;s too big, drink half and leave.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Until the food arrived I drank and read the travel guide. Crete is the long and&nbsp; narrow Greek island closest to Africa. On the island are no trains; travelers move by bus. The biggest city is Iraklion, near the famed ruins of the maze at the palace of Knossos.&nbsp; Olive cultivation is the primary industry; wine is also highly prized. Wind is strong;&nbsp; windmills galore. For various political reasons the island was the last to achieve&nbsp; independence from Turkey, therefore the cultural atmosphere is different from the rest of&nbsp; Greece. The island is known for its &ldquo;fighting spirit&rdquo; and fierce resistance against the&nbsp; Germans during the Second World War. Nikos Kazantzakis used the island as the setting&nbsp; for his novel <em>Zorba the Greek</em>. The knowledge I gained from the Crete travel guide ended&nbsp; there. What real life was like there I couldn&rsquo;t know. Well that&rsquo;s how it is, right? A travel&nbsp; guide is a book for folks just passing through; it&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s written for people who&nbsp; want to settle down and live.</p>

<p>I tried to imagine life on Crete with the woman who was once Creta Kano. Just&nbsp; what kind of life would we lead? What kind of house would we live in? What kind of&nbsp; food would we eat? What we would do upon waking? What kind of conversation would&nbsp; we have all day? And would we go on for months, years? Nothing I could call an&nbsp; &ldquo;image&rdquo; came to mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, I thought, no matter what I&rsquo;m in for I can beat it for Crete just as it is. I can&nbsp; go and live with the woman who was once Creta Kano. For a while I alternated stares between the two travel guides on the table and the brand-new suitcase at my feet. These&nbsp; were my &ldquo;possibility&rdquo; taken physical form. To visualize that concept called possibility I&nbsp; marched into town and bought the suitcase and guides. And the more I looked the more&nbsp; enticing a possibility it appeared. Suitcase in hand I ought to shuck off everything and flee from here. Simple.</p>

<p>Sitting at home awaiting Kumiko&rsquo;s return was about all I could do staying in Japan. No, first of all, she&rsquo;s not coming back. Don&rsquo;t wait for me, don&rsquo;t search, she&rsquo;d&nbsp; insisted in her letter. Of course, no matter what I was told I had a right to keep waiting.&nbsp; Only doing so might grind me down. I might be even more alone, groping in a deeper&nbsp; darkness, my power on the wane. The problem: I am no one&rsquo;s necessity.</p>

<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s necessary I go to Crete with Malta Kano&rsquo;s sister. Like she said, it&nbsp; would be for me, and for her, a good thing. I stared again at the suitcase at my feet. I&nbsp; imagined myself carrying this suitcase, alighting in Iraklion Airport with Creta Kano. I&nbsp; imagined a tranquil life in a village somewhere: eating fish, swimming in the deep blue&nbsp; sea. But while imagining those impossible picture-postcard dreams, a solid cloudlike&nbsp; something expanded in my breast. New suitcase in one hand, mobbed by shoppers&nbsp; crowding the Shinjuku street, like an air hole was plugged I struggled to breathe. I could&nbsp; hardly move my own hands and feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">That time, as I left the restaurant and walked the street, the suitcase I carried&nbsp; swiped the leg of an oncoming man. The young man of large build wore a gray T-shirt&nbsp; and baseball cap. He had Walkman earphones stuck in his ears. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; I&nbsp; apologized. The man only adjusted his baseball cap, and as if extending his arm straight&nbsp; out thrust it unhesitatingly into my chest. As it was totally unexpected I crumpled and&nbsp; cracked my head against the wall of a building. The man watched me fall, then without a&nbsp; single change in expression walked off and disappeared. For a moment I thought to chase&nbsp; him down, but reconsidered and gave it up. No point doing that. I got up, took a deep&nbsp; breath and brushed the dirt off my pants. Then I took up my suitcase again. Someone&nbsp; picked up the dropped books and handed them back to me. It was a little old lady wearing&nbsp; a nearly brimless hat. That was a really weirdly shaped hat. When she handed me the&nbsp; books she shook her head a bit, without saying a thing. Looking at that old woman&rsquo;s hat&nbsp; and sympathetic face, I recalled for no reason the Wind-Up Bird. The Wind-Up Bird somewhere in the depths of the forest. My head hurt for a bit, but I had nothing you could&nbsp; call an injury, just a bump that appeared on the back of my head. Probably best if I go&nbsp; home early, I thought. Got to return to that silent alley.</p>

<p>To calm my nerves I bought a newspaper and lemon drops at a kiosk in the station.&nbsp; I took my wallet from my pocket and paid cash, then clutching that newspaper I turned&nbsp; and walked toward the ticket gate. I heard a woman's voice from behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, Mister!&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;Over there, Mister tall guy with a <em>mark </em>on his face!&rdquo; That was me. Calling was the girl from the counter. Not knowing what was going&nbsp; on, I turned around.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forgot your change,&rdquo; she said, then gave me change in coins from 1,000 yen.&nbsp; I said thanks and took it. &ldquo;Sorry I mentioned the <em>mark</em>,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t think of&nbsp; another way to call you so it just slipped out.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I managed to float an &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind&rdquo; sort of smile on my face and shook my head.&nbsp; She looked at the mark. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re covered with sweat, though; you ok? Not feeling sick?&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot so I started sweating while walking. Thanks,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I rode the train and read the newspaper. Until that moment I hadn&rsquo;t realized, but it&nbsp; had been a long time since I&rsquo;d actually handled a newspaper. We didn&rsquo;t take the&nbsp; newspaper. When commuting, if she felt like it Kumiko would buy a morning daily from&nbsp; the station and bring it back home for me. The next day I would read the previous day&rsquo;s&nbsp; news. I read the newspaper for the classifieds. But with Kumiko&rsquo;s disappearance, the&nbsp; paper-bestowing people in my life disappeared as well. Nothing written in the paper&nbsp; caught my interest. I flipped every page from front to back, but there wasn&rsquo;t a single&nbsp; thing in there I needed to know. I closed the paper and scanned the weekly ads hanging in&nbsp; the train one by one, when suddenly my eye landed on the name &ldquo;Noboru Wataya.&rdquo;&nbsp; There, in great big letters: &ldquo;Mr. Noboru Wataya&rsquo;s Political Debut Makes Waves.&rdquo; For a&nbsp; long time I stared up at that &ldquo;Noboru Wataya.&rdquo; So that guy really means it. He really&nbsp; means to become a politician. I thought, in this alone there&rsquo;s value in getting out of Japan.&nbsp;</p>

<p> I carried my empty suitcase to the station and rode the bus home. It was an empty&nbsp; husk of a house, but I was nonetheless relieved to be home. I took a short rest, then went&nbsp; to the bathroom to take a shower. Inside the bathroom not a shadow of Kumiko remained.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Toothbrush, shower cap, makeup and all had disappeared. No stockings or underwear&nbsp; were drying there; her special shampoo was gone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I stepped out of the shower, and drying my body with a towel I realized I should&nbsp; have bought the weekly carrying the Noboru Wataya article. Wondering just what was&nbsp; written in there started to weigh on my mind. Then I shook my head. If Noboru Wataya&nbsp; wants to become a politician, let him. In this country anyone who wants to become a&nbsp; politician has got the right to. With Kumiko leaving me, the relationship between Noboru&nbsp; Wataya and I was essentially severed; where his life was headed from then on wasn&rsquo;t a&nbsp; thing I would know. Just as where my life was headed was of no concern to him. That was fine. <em>It should have been that way from the very beginning</em>.</p>

<p>But I couldn&rsquo;t chase that weekly&rsquo;s headline out of my head. I spent that whole&nbsp; afternoon organizing the closet and the kitchen, but no matter what other things I thought&nbsp; about or busied my body with, that big &ldquo;Noboru Wataya&rdquo; printed on the hanging&nbsp; advertisement&rsquo;s vivid afterimage floated out and hovered in front of my eyes. It was just&nbsp; like a distant telephone bell, heard through the wall in the next room. While that phone&nbsp; rang unanswered it rang on and on and on. I tried to believe it didn&rsquo;t exist. I tried to&nbsp; pretend I couldn&rsquo;t hear. But it was no use. I gave up, walked as far as the nearest&nbsp; convenience store, bought the weekly and returned.</p>

<p>Sitting in a chair in the kitchen drinking tea, I read the article. Famous economist&nbsp; and critic Noboru Wataya is definitely considering the candidacy for Niigata XX Ward in&nbsp; the House of Representatives for the next election, it was written. A detailed personal&nbsp; history followed: academic, literary and mass media activities of the last few years. His&nbsp; uncle Yoshitaka Wataya, Representative for Niigata XX Ward, citing health concerns&nbsp; announced his withdrawal from the next race; for lack of another suitably well-known&nbsp; and influential successor, if talks continue smoothly he will likely attempt to have his&nbsp; nephew Noboru Wataya succeed him in that candidacy. If that happens, considering the&nbsp; strength of the current Representative Wataya&rsquo;s constituency and his nephew&rsquo;s youth and&nbsp; public presence, is not Noboru Wataya a shoo-in for election? they wrote. &ldquo;The&nbsp; probability Mr. Noboru will file candidacy is, say, 95 percent. The particulars will be&nbsp; negotiated, but ultimately since he himself seems motivated it seems things will turn out&nbsp; the way they should,&rdquo; said a local &ldquo;influential person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A talk with Noboru Wataya was also included. It was a pretty long talk. He said at&nbsp; this time he had not yet decided to file a formal candidacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Certainly such talk is circulating. But I have my own ideas; it&rsquo;s not a problem where I&rsquo;m&nbsp; offered, &ldquo;Come out and run,&rdquo; and can simply answer, &ldquo;Yes. Got it. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; Between&nbsp; what I am seeking in the world of politics and what it is seeking from me there may be&nbsp; considerable discrepancy. So from now on if little by little discussion is maintained,&nbsp; perhaps modulation will take place. However, if both sides agree and I actually come&nbsp; forward as a candidate, by all means I certainly intend to be elected, and after my&nbsp; election I have no intention of serving as a coolie-hatted backbencher. I&rsquo;m only 37; if&nbsp; from here I choose the path of a politician the road ahead is long. I&rsquo;ve got a clear&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;vision&rdquo; and the power to present it to the people. My long-range vision and strategy will&nbsp; serve as fundaments in my endeavors. My current aim is the next 15 years. Within the&nbsp; 20</em><em>th </em><em>Century, as a politician I definitely intend to place this nation of Japan in a position&nbsp; where its particular identity may be established. That is the objective for the time being.&nbsp; What I am aiming to do is free Japan from its current place in the political hinterlands&nbsp; and thrust it upwards as a unified political and cultural model. In other words, to&nbsp; reshape the framework of the state we call Japan, to forgo hypocrisy and establish logic&nbsp; and ethics. What are important are not opaque phrases and endless rhetoric, but a clear&nbsp; image one can grasp. We are coming to a time where we must grasp that sort of clear&nbsp; image, and construct that sort of state and popular consensus now sought by the people.&nbsp; Now, the kind of senseless politics we are engaged in will ultimately leave our country&nbsp; tossed on the ebbing tide, swept along like a giant jellyfish. We have no interest in ideals&nbsp; or dreams. What I am talking about is simply what must be done, and that which must be&nbsp; done, no matter what, must not remain undone. I have a concrete policy plan tailored to&nbsp; that purpose that will be elucidated following the progress of our situation.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The weekly&rsquo;s article seemed mostly slanted in favor of Noboru Wataya. Mr.&nbsp; Noboru Wataya: a sharp-witted, brilliant political and economic critic whose eloquence&nbsp; was noted early on. Young, of good breeding: a promising future as a politician. His&nbsp; &ldquo;long-range strategy&rdquo; probably not a pipe dream but actually feasible. Most voters welcome his political debut. For his conservative constituency his divorcee and single&nbsp; status may pose a bit of a problem, but his youth and mental aptitude will more than&nbsp; compensate for those &ldquo;minus points.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s certain to rake in the female vote. &ldquo;Even so,&rdquo;&nbsp; the article tied up the end in a bit of a dry tone, &ldquo;Noboru Wataya&rsquo;s inheritance of his&nbsp; uncle&rsquo;s constituency doesn&rsquo;t necessarily escape the view that it is enabled by the&nbsp; &lsquo;senseless politics&rsquo; he criticizes. His lofty political views have a convincing ring to them,&nbsp; but how far they will carry practical political efficacy, we can only wait and see.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I finished reading the article about Noboru Wataya I tossed the weekly into&nbsp; the kitchen trashcan. Then I tried to fill my suitcase with the clothes and things I would&nbsp; need to go to Crete. How cold the winter gets in Crete I had no idea. Looking at the map&nbsp; it was close to Africa. Even so, in Africa depending on the place the winter can get pretty&nbsp; cold. I pulled out a leather jumper and stuck it in the suitcase. Then two sweaters, two&nbsp; pairs of slacks. Two long-sleeved shirts and three short-sleeved. Tweed jacket. T-shirts and shorts. Socks and underwear. Hat and sunglasses. Swimwear. Towel. Travel toiletries&nbsp; case. Even with that stuff the suitcase was only about halfway full. But in terms of&nbsp; &ldquo;essentials&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t really think of anything else.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the time being I closed the lid of the suitcase and managed to feel like I was&nbsp; really going to get out of Japan. I am leaving this house, and going to leave this country.&nbsp; While sucking a lemon drop I concentrated for a moment on my brand-new suitcase. That&nbsp; when Kumiko left the house she didn&rsquo;t even carry a suitcase suddenly popped into my&nbsp; mind. Carrying only a small shoulder bag and the skirt and blouse she&rsquo;d picked up from&nbsp; the cleaner&rsquo;s by the station, in the sunny summer morning she went away from here. The&nbsp; luggage she&rsquo;d carried was even smaller than mine.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I thought about the jellyfish. <em>This kind of senseless politics will ultimately leave&nbsp; our country tossed on the ebbing tide, swept along like a giant jellyfish, </em>Noboru Wataya&nbsp; had said. Had Noboru Wataya ever seen a real jellyfish up close? I had. Though hating it&nbsp; the whole time, while I went on a date with Kumiko at the aquarium I saw with my own&nbsp; eyes the shapes of jellyfish from all around the world. Kumiko stood before each tank,&nbsp; hardly saying anything, intent on the calm and graceful movements of the jellyfish.&nbsp; Though it was our first date she seemed to completely forget I was beside her. There&nbsp;</p>

<p>really were various kinds of jellyfish of various size and shape. Comb jellies, Beroe&nbsp; jellies, Venus&rsquo;s girdle jellies, lion&rsquo;s mane jellies&hellip; Kumiko was immersed in those&nbsp; jellyfish, so much so that I bought her an illustrated book about jellyfish as a present.&nbsp; Noboru Wataya probably doesn&rsquo;t know it, but some jellyfish actually have bones, even&nbsp; muscles. Some breathe oxygen, even defecate. Some have sperm and eggs. And, they use&nbsp; their feelers and umbrella to make beautiful movements. It&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re just getting&nbsp; tossed around in the tide. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m trying to defend jellyfish or anything, but they&nbsp; have their own will to live.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hey, Noboru Wataya-kun, I said. I don&rsquo;t care if you become a politician. That&rsquo;s&nbsp; up to you. It&rsquo;s not a problem I&rsquo;ll open my mouth about. But, at least let me say this: it&rsquo;s a&nbsp; mistake using a faulty metaphor to insult jellyfish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After nine that night the phone rang. But for a while I didn&rsquo;t take the receiver.&nbsp; Staring at the ringing phone on the table, I wondered who it could be. What could anyone&nbsp; want from me?&nbsp;</p>
<p>But then I realized who it was. It was that <em>phone woman</em>. How I could tell I didn&rsquo;t&nbsp; know, but I was sure. She was seeking me from that strange, dark room. In there even&nbsp; now drifted the heady scent of flowers. Even now she was there nursing her fierce sexual&nbsp; desire. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything, you know. Even things your wife won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; In the end I didn&rsquo;t&nbsp; pick up the receiver. The bell rang ten times, cut, and rang for another twelve. From then&nbsp; it was silent. A silence more profound than before. My heartbeat sounded out loud. I&nbsp; stared for a long time at my fingertips. I imagined the blood sent from my heart taking&nbsp; time to make its way to my fingertips. Then I quietly covered my face with my hands,&nbsp; and took a deep breath.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the silence only the dry tock-tock of the clock echoed in the room. I went to the&nbsp; bedroom, sat on the floor and for a while again stared at my new suitcase. <em>Crete, huh? </em>I&nbsp; thought. Sorry, but I&rsquo;ve decided to go to Crete. I&rsquo;m a little tired of living here under the&nbsp; name Tōru Okada. &ldquo;As the man who was once Tōru Okada, I&rsquo;ve decided to go to Crete&nbsp; with the woman who was once Creta Kano,&rdquo; I tried saying out loud. But to whom I was&nbsp; saying it, even I didn&rsquo;t know. <em>Someone</em>.</p>

<p><em>Tock-tock-tock-tock-tock-tock</em>, the clock struck time, as if that sound was&nbsp; interlocked with the beat of my heart.&nbsp;</p>
