  <h1>Lost Chapters in Murakami's <em>Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</em></h1>
<p>Murakami Haruki is among the most translated living Japanese authors. His novel Nejimakidori
kuronikuru (1994, 1995) has been translated into English as The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (1997)
by Jay Rubin, who cut about sixty-one of 1,379 pages, including three chapters (Book 2 Chapters
  15, 18, and part of 17; and Book 3 Chapter 26). Other sections were rearranged or altered.</p>
  <p>I'm a linguist named <a style="color:red" href="https://kieranmaynard.com/">Kieran Maynard</a>. I
believe the deleted sections should be included in the translation, as they invite new interpretations
and enhance appreciation of the novel. This is the subject of a <a style="color:red" href="  https://www.uog.edu/_resources/files/schools-and-colleges/college-of-liberal-arts-and-social-sciences/maynard_lost-chapters-wind-up-bird.pdf
    ">research paper</a> I published in University of Guam's <em>Pacific Asia Inquiry</em> journal.</p>
  <p>After more than a decade, there is still no sign of an unabridged translation of the novel, so I have made these translations available here for readers to enjoy.</p>
  <p><em>Many thanks to Dr. Masaki Mori, Dr. Tim Cross, and the Univeristy of Georgia Center for Undergraduate Research Opprtunities for supporting this research.</em></p>
  <p>Mistakes are my own. Please reach out with corrections and comments.</p>
